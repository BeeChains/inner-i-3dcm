# Inner ‘I’ Consciousness Model

![Visualization](results/inner_i_network.html)

The **Inner ‘I’ Consciousness Model** is a Python-based interactive neural network framework designed to visualize and explore the concept of **awareness** and its relationship to the **seven states of consciousness**. This project bridges **neuroscience**, **artificial intelligence**, and **philosophy**, creating a compelling 3D interactive map of consciousness.

## **Overview**

### **Concept**
The **Inner 'I' Consciousness** represents the **observer**, the infinite awareness underlying all experiences. This neural network maps the progression of consciousness from its foundational layer (**Inner ‘I’**) through the following seven states of awareness:

1. **Waking**  
2. **Sleeping**  
3. **Dreaming**  
4. **Transcendental Consciousness**  
5. **Cosmic Consciousness**  
6. **God Consciousness**  
7. **Unity Consciousness**

Each state is modeled as a neural network layer, with neurons symbolizing individual units of awareness.

### **Features**
1. **Interactive 3D Neural Map**:
   - Explore the neural network structure with **hoverable tooltips** displaying details about layers, states of consciousness, and neurons.
   - Fully interactive: Rotate, zoom, and inspect connections.
   - Saved as a sharable `.html` file.

2. **Customizable Neural Architecture**:
   - Define the number of neurons in each layer and the connections between layers.

3. **Training Metrics**:
   - Train the model and save accuracy/loss plots over epochs.

4. **Shareable Results**:
   - Save visualizations (both interactive and static) and training metrics for blogs, presentations, or research.
